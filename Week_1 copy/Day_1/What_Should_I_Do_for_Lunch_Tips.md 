### Tips

Try experimenting with the comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `===`, etc.) in the node REPL, which you can launch using the `node` command in Vagrant.

Work on your code iteratively â€“ that means in small pieces. 

To help you figure out how to use `hungry` and `availableTime` inside your function, try outputting their values to the Terminal as follows.


```javascript
const whatToDoForLunch = function(hungry, availableTime) {
  console.log("I don't know what to do!");

  if(hungry === true && availableTime  <= 20){
    console.log("eat it in the lab");
  }else if(hungry===true && (20<availableTime || availableTime<30)){
    console.log("try a place nearby ")
  }else if(hungry===true && availableTime>30){
    console.log("you are in the bootcamp do not waste time"); 
  }else if(hungry===false){
    console.log("go back to work")
  }

}

```
